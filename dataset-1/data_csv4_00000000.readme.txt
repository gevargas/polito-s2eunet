======

Every row is a measure.

## FILTERING

First of all, I will consider only the most simple test "speedtest". So filter
where "test_name"="speedtest".

## FEATURES

Interesting features are:

1. download_speed

This is the speed of the connection that has been measured in each single test.
This is the main information that we want to correlate to other features.

  1.1 latency

  This is the "delay" of the connection, should be higher for 3G than for ADSL
  or fiber, may be related to the download_speed. 

2. uuid

This is the id of the user, every user has a unique id, so you can tell to which user the measure belongs

3. #client_address

This is the IP address of the user machine that performed the test. It is an
address that belongs to an Internet Service Provide, in a particular Location
and with a particular connection (ADSL, 3G, Fiber, etc.)

  3.1 client_provider, asnum
 
  This is the provider the user is paying for the internet connection

  
  3.2 city, region, client_country, lon, lat

  These are information on the location of the client, with also longitude and latitude


4. timestamp, hour, month, year, weekday, day, filedate

These are the information on when the measure has been recorded


## CLUSTERING

A. Detect the technology used for the connection to the Internet

At the present moment, Neubot, do not ask the user if he is using ADSL, 3G or
so on. We may think of extracting this information from the data, e.g., looking
at the fact that different technologies have different download_speed and
latency.

B. Detect how speed/latency, provider, location, timestamp/weekday/hour are correlated
